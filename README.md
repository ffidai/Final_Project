## Background

The goal of our project is to expand on the image classification model and utilize video classification to differentiate between various sports movements. Ideally, the model can be used to help athletes, physicla therapists, and doctors better understand how sports movements affects the body. As a start, we will look at two basic tennis movements: forehand and backhand. In order to acheieve this, we will create a convulutional neural network (CNN). 

## Tools Used

* Deep/Machine Learning: Tensorflow, Keras, ResNet 50 (Residual Networks)
  * achieve image/video classification
* Python & Flask
  * run the demo on a web page
* HTML/CSS/Boostrap
  * house the data in a digestible format
