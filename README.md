# Final Project: Sports Medicine through Video Classification 

![Tennis](https://github.com/ffidai/Final_Project/data/forehand/0001.jpg "Differentiating between Forehand & Backhand Tennis Movements")


## Background

Sports medicine is a branch of medicine that deals with physical fitness and the treatment and prevention of injuries related to sports and exercise. Although most sports teams have employed team physicians for many years, it is only since the late 20th century that sports medicine has emerged as a distinct field of health care.

* Shoulder Impingement
    * overhead shots and serving
* CalfÂ tears
    * planting the foot down 
* TennisÂ Elbow
    * repetitive movements including backhand strokes

Good technique and racquet grip is important to reduce the risk of the injuryÂ developing. In all of the above, itâ€™s important to note that correct technique and coaching for tennis and racquet sports is very important! All the above necessitates granular and processed data on every muscle movement of player to be recorded and analyzed.

## Goal

The goal of our project is to expand on the image classification model and utilize video classification to differentiate between various sports movements. Ideally, the model can be used to help athletes, physical therapists, and doctors better understand how sports movements affects the body. An unintended use for this model can be to predict players' behavior and movements which can be used to help teams/sports insititutions select team rosters and viewers place players in fanatasy leagues and legal bets. 

As a start, we will look at two basic tennis movements: forehand and backhand. In order to acheieve this, we will create a convulutional neural (CNN). 

## Tools Used

* Deep/Machine Learning: Tensorflow, Keras, ResNet 50 (Residual Networks)
  * achieve image/video classification
* Python & Flask
  * run the demo on a web page
* Pandas & Tableau 
  * export data in Excel to visualize trend results
  * this can help improve the code overtime to see variances between players/movements
* HTML/CSS/Boostrap
  * house the data in a digestible format

## The Process & Code Highlights



### Creating a key for tennis movements
In order to create a successful video classifier, we had to create sample videos to recognize the two different movements and then use test videos to see if our code is sound. Given our time and expertise we will classfiy any accuracy and probability testing above a failing grade (50%) to be succesful. 

Our sample and testing clips were recorded in house by the team. The basic code is meant to be transferrable regardless of expert level, gender, and race.
